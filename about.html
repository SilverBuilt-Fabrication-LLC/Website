<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>My passion for fabrication started with a love for cars. At 15 years old, I began turning my first vehicle, an S10 pickup truck, into a drift truck and realized welding was the key to building the cars I dreamed about. From there, I went all in – watching videos, reading books, and learning everything I could about TIG welding long before I went to school for it. 
<br/><br/>
I eventually earned my associates degree in welding and fabrication, and now work TIG welding aerospace parts – all of which go through strict x-ray and liquid penetrant inspection. That experience, combined with hands-on projects and motorsports-specific training through HPA Academy, led me to start my own business: SilverBuilt Fabrication.
<br/><br/>
I focus on precision, quality, and clean work – no shortcuts. Whether it’s custom exhausts, intakes, tubing or functional builds like tables and shelves, I aim to create work that performs, lasts, and looks good doing it. 
<br/><br/>
Thanks for following along – I look forward to making your projects come to life.
